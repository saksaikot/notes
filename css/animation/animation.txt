fill-mode:3
forwards state stays at 100%

backwards: immediate start at 0% state then delay then 100% then back to original state

both: first backward then forwards

animation count: 1 to infinite 

if animation count is more then 1 then another property can be used.
alternate is 0 to 100 then 100 to 0 percent

6.handling size , height , width with animation is not efficient .
we need  to use transform.
