transform have bunch of function to animate an element

transform does not re-render the html structure just the element it intended for.

1. scale(2);// scale x and y to times 2
scale(1,2) scale x to 1 times and y to 2 times
scaleX(1) scaleY(2) // same

note: transform can process multiple functions but in order left to right

2.rotate(90deg)
rotate(.75turn)
rotate(.65rad)

3.translate://translate to move a content up/down or left or right
(x-direction)
(x-direction,y-direction)

or translateX(1px) translateY(3px)

translate(100%);// this 100% is the current element not its parent element.
so 100% means move the element to right with 100% width of this element


css variable cannot be used in animation like normally can do with css.

we can use like this
transform: scale(var(--scale))

but not like: --scale:1.5
