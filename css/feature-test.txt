we can check if a specific feature is available in the browser, if not we can give a fallback css.

the revert property of background color is available in firefox but not in chrome
so we can check like this

@supports (background-color:revert){
  .div{
    background-color:revert;
  }
}

or like this as fallback
@supports not (background-color:revert){
  .div{
    background-color:transparent;
  }
}

we can also check with 'and' and 'or'
