position:static,relative,absolute,fixed,sticky


if you want to move an element within its container then container needs to be set relative or absolute.

just relative: element takes default place but can be moved by top,bottom,left,right property

position absolute:
removes from document flow,
takes 1st place of container, top,bottom,left,right will be for its container

position fixed : top,left,right,bottom container is view height and width,based on entire screen

position sticky: same as absolute with element stays as same position, will take normal space or normal document flow,
